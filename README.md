AFK Bot for 6B6T Using MineFlayer (Microsoft/Premium Account)

1.  Install all the dependencies
   ``` npm install mineflayer mineflayer-auto-eat discord.js axios```
2. Create a Discord Bot from https://discord.com/developers/applications (Give it all the Privileged Gateway Intents)

3. Create the Channels, Create Webhooks & Create an Admin Role (Admin role can use the commands, others can't)

4. Replace The Webhooks, Channel ID & Discord Bot Token

5. Run it, Link with your Microsoft Account

6. Then The Discord Bot & Minecraft Bot should be online and working.


This works on a hosting Website.
I'll be working on this and trying to add more commands/features every now and then. Please suggest some features and I'll try implement them.
